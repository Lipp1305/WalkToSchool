WALK TO SCHOOL




I have lots of lectures in a building that is a far walk from my house, and i was curious as to what the quickest way to walk there was.

I designed a graph for my campus, highlighting all of the places on my walk where i have multiple options of which path to take. I then walked each path at a steady pace, timing how long it took to get from each point to another. Once i recorded all of my data, i made an adjacency matrix to relate all of the connected points on the walk to another.
